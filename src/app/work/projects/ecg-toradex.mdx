## Overview

As UX/UI designer, I guided the creation of an interactive ECG demo designed to showcase intuitive, realistic, and clinically relevant user interfaces using LVGL on embedded medical hardware. My role encompassed extensive UX research, advanced prototyping, and meticulous visual design, ensuring the final interface was highly adaptable, visually impactful, and aligned with professional medical standards.

## Key Features

- **Real-time ECG Visualization**: Interactive display of medical data with clear visual differentiation between standard, alarm, and disabled states.
- **Animated UI Transitions**: Fluid animations and transitions between different screen layouts and interaction states.
- **Figma Tokens matching medical requirements**: Many time disigners think about variable modes as simple toggles between dark/light mode. But those are just a organization tool that can be used to resolve many kind of problem, as in this case, to switch the UI between the diffent state; from critical alarms to disabled button.
- **UX Research for a realistic demo**: Our client wanted only a demo, which normally requires a stunning UI and eyecatching graphics; but in this case they were looking for something professional to show to clinicians; something realistic not that far from a real ECG screen. 

## Technologies Used

- **LVGL**: Lightweight graphics library optimized for embedded systems.
- **Figma**: Design tool for visual prototyping and collaborative design workflows.
- **Docker & Torizon OS**: Containerized deployment and execution on embedded Linux hardware.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was balancing visual sophistication with embedded hardware constraints, including resolution adjustments from 12" to 10" displays. Effective integration of third-party libraries like FFMPEG and tiny_ttf also presented complexities in build processes and runtime performance.

The design team's primary learning was understanding how to effectively translate high-fidelity designs from Figma into embedded-compatible formats for LVGL, fostering close collaboration between design and development teams.

## Outcome

The ECG demo was successfully validated on Toradex hardware, receiving enthusiastic client approval. Notably, the visual and functional quality was recognized as superior to competing commercial solutions. This project now serves as a valuable reference, positioning LVGL as a competitive, open-source solution for sophisticated medical device interfaces.
