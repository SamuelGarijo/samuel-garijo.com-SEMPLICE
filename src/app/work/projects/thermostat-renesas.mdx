**Project Duration:** November 2024 - February 2025
**Role:** UI Designer
**Tools:** Figma, LVGL, Human Factors Research

Led UI design for embedded thermostat interface showcasing Renesas EK-RA8D1 evaluation kit at Embedded World 2025, reaching 15,000+ industry professionals through high-visibility trade show demonstration.

## Project Context

Renesas, the world's 16th largest semiconductor corporation, partnered with LVGL (leading open-source embedded graphics library) to demonstrate next-generation embedded UI capabilities. The collaboration aimed to prove that smartphone-like interfaces could run efficiently on embedded hardware—a critical advancement for IoT and smart home applications.

**Business Objective:** Showcase EK-RA8D1 running Zephyr OS with LVGL integration at Embedded World 2025, demonstrating technical capabilities to potential enterprise customers and development partners.

## My Role and Team Collaboration

Working remotely from Spain, I served as UI Designer for an international team:
- **Felipe Neves** (Technical Lead, Brazil): Hardware integration and performance optimization
- **Gabor Kiss-Vámosi** (LVGL CEO, Hungary): Graphics library implementation
- **John Kikidis** (Renesas, Greece): Stakeholder management and trade show coordination

My responsibilities centered on creating the visual interface that would demonstrate both Renesas hardware capabilities and LVGL's graphics potential to industry decision-makers.

## Design Challenges and Constraints

### Trade Show Performance Pressure
**Hard January 2025 deadline** with December delivery requirement for stakeholder review and hardware integration testing. The interface needed to "pop" visually for trade show impact while maintaining the reliability expected of industrial hardware demonstrations.

### Embedded Hardware Limitations
**Memory constraints:** Limited graphics storage meant every UI element required optimization—high-resolution images or complex animations could cause performance failures during live demonstrations.

**Non-standard display specifications:** 4.5" screen with unique pixel density (854 pixels across 96mm) required custom text sizing calculations, as standard web/mobile guidelines (16px base fonts, 9px minimums) don't apply to embedded displays.

**Physical viewing context:** Wall-mounted thermostat viewed from ~1 meter distance demanded different legibility requirements than handheld devices.

## When There's No Standard: Designing Readable Text from Scratch

Designing for embedded systems like the Renesas RA8D1-EK presents a unique challenge: there's no UI kit, no mobile OS, and no standard screen scaling like @2x or @3x. You're working pixel-perfect at 1x, and every decision about spacing or typography has direct physical consequences.

With no clear documentation about minimum font sizes for this specific device, I decided to reverse-engineer a custom typographic standard from first principles.

### Research-Driven Starting Point
Using Perplexity.ai and human factors literature, I found that 5mm is often cited as the minimum text height for comfortable readability at arm's length (≈1 meter)—a common scenario for fixed, wall-mounted or desk-level embedded screens.

### Math Meets Reality
Knowing the Renesas screen has:
- 854 vertical pixels
- A 10cm physical height (≈100mm)
- → That gives us 8.54 px/mm

So: 5mm × 8.54 px/mm ≈ 42.7 pixels

That's the theoretical minimum pixel height for text to remain legible from a distance—almost 43 px. However, I immediately recognized that this number felt high, especially for compact layouts.

### Real-World Testing with Prototypes
Rather than relying blindly on formulas, I prototyped layouts using physical-size mockups on my iPad at a 1:1 scale (480x854 px, the screen's actual resolution). I tested font sizes from 24px to 44px, observing how readable they were under typical usage conditions.

**What I found:**
- 16 px is far too small for anything critical (confirmed by colleagues and real-world feedback)
- **32 px struck the perfect balance**—readable, spatially efficient, and visually aligned with the hierarchy
- This became my new minimum baseline for CTA labels, primary values, and time indicators

> "Ensure to get the minimum and maximum font sizes right because the font size for all other components will be according to this." — Aela Design, Typography in UI: How To Enhance User Experience

### Creating Design System for Underserved Category
Embedded thermostat interfaces lack the comprehensive pattern libraries available for web/mobile design (Dribbble, Mobbin). This required building systematic visual references from scratch.

**Solution:** I created my own design system library, categorizing existing thermostat interfaces by component type and function—essentially building "Mobbin for embedded HVAC."

**Design evolution process:**
1. **Wireframing:** Structured layouts prioritizing essential functions (current temperature, target temperature, basic controls)
2. **Visual research:** Systematic gathering of references from traditional thermostats, smart home interfaces, and related control devices
3. **Synthesis:** Combining functional requirements with aesthetic insights to create interfaces that feel both familiar and modern

## Results and Professional Impact

**Executive Validation:** Senior Staff Business Development Engineer Otto Aureliano Rolloff personally demonstrated the interface in official Renesas video content, indicating company confidence in the design as their primary showcase for RA8D1 + Zephyr RTOS integration.

**Strategic Partnership Success:** The thermostat interface became the official demonstration example for Renesas hardware capabilities, with the collaboration contributing to LVGL's subsequent built-in support for Renesas hardware across multiple development boards.

**Trade Show Achievement:** Interface successfully showcased at Embedded World 2025 in Nürnberg, representing Renesas technical capabilities to 15,000+ industry professionals.

**Technical Achievements:**
- Established reusable text sizing methodology for embedded displays using human factors research
- Successfully optimized interface performance within memory constraints while maintaining visual appeal
- Created systematic design approach bridging consumer UI expectations with embedded hardware limitations
